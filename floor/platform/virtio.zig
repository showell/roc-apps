//! virtio over MMIO: the transport, and the block device on it.
//!
//! **THIS IS THE DEVICE THE FLOOR'S DISK DOOR WAS ALREADY SHAPED FOR.** A
//! virtio-blk request is a header naming a sector, a data buffer named by
//! ADDRESS, and a status byte -- which is `Disk.read!(lba, addr)` and its
//! outcome, arrived at from the other direction. Nothing here copies a sector;
//! the device writes into the page the caller named.
//!
//! The transport is virtio-mmio, not PCI: a device is a window of registers at
//! a known physical address, with a magic value at offset 0 and no bus to
//! enumerate. That is what QEMU's `microvm` machine and Firecracker give a
//! guest, and it is the smallest thing that could possibly work. A cloud VM
//! hands out the same devices behind PCI instead, which is a discovery
//! problem and not a different driver.
//!
//! The spec is virtio 1.2. Register offsets and constants below are its
//! numbers, not ours.
