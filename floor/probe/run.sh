#!/bin/bash
# The virtio probe kernel, booted under QEMU's microvm machine against a copy
# of a disk image.
#
#   floor/probe/run.sh [image]
#
# With no image it uses a copy of Cobblestone's fat16-write.disk. **The image
# is always copied first**: the probe writes to the last sector to prove the
# device writes where it was told, and it must never do that to a fixture.
#
# Two flags here are not obvious and both were found the hard way:
#
#   -global virtio-mmio.force-legacy=false
#       QEMU's virtio-mmio defaults to the LEGACY interface (version 1). The
#       driver speaks virtio 1.2 and refuses to pretend otherwise, so without
#       this every transport reads version 1 and nothing matches.
#
#   -M microvm
#       is what has virtio-mmio at all. The ordinary `pc` machine has PCI
#       instead, which is a different discovery path.
#
# **QEMU'S EXIT CODE IS NOT THE GUEST'S.** isa-debug-exit ends the guest with
# `code << 1 | 1`, so the kernel's 0 arrives as 1 and its 1 arrives as 3. This
# script maps them back, so its own exit code means what it says.
